We will need 3 json files with lists of the words needed for each of the blanks.
one word type per json
ajax call them into 3 arrays at the load of the page.

On click of a very large button in the center of the page (pre written on index.html):
generate a random number for each array to use as an index to each array.

    replace the button using .html with ( append 3 divs inline that each have their chosen word )

    using 3 separate functions that each slice off from their arrays. append the three words to the DOM in very large text each in their own div inline.


on the click of any word, it will slide down and be replaced by a slid-up new word of the category via the 3 previously mentioned functions.

If we run out of words- alert a link to therapy.
